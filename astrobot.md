<h2>AI-powered assistant designed to support astronomical workflows.</h2>

<!-- Texto principal -->
<p>
<strong>AstroBot</strong> is a professional-grade conversational assistant designed to support <strong>astronomical data workflows</strong> through <strong>natural language interaction</strong>.  
I am developing this tool as part of a <strong>research scholarship</strong> awarded by the <strong>Instituto de Data Science Argentina (IDSA)</strong>, under the direction of <strong>PhD. Ignacio Urteaga</strong>.  
The system is built with a <strong>modular architecture</strong> that integrates <strong>NLP pipelines</strong>, <strong>astronomical catalog access</strong>, and <strong>structured interaction logic</strong>.  
Although the <strong>technical details and implementation</strong> cannot be publicly disclosed due to <strong>confidentiality agreements</strong>, <strong>AstroBot</strong> is being developed at a high level of <strong>software and data engineering standards</strong>, with a focus on <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>domain-specific relevance for astronomy research</strong>.
